# FlareDB ðŸ”¥
## Introduction:

FlareDb is an ongoing project  that focuses on simplicity and efficiency. It is intended to be a self hosted database where individuals will be able to host and use with ease. The purpose of  `FlareDb` is not to compete with the likes of `sqlite`, `mongodb` and so on but rather to aid our organisation [CodeTheEarth](https://github.com/CodeTheEarth)

## Features:
- JSON document based database (inspo from `mongodb`) 
- Single `.db` file database(inspo from `sqlite`)
- Indexing
- Ease of use
- Zero external dependencies
- Low ram usage (10k documents -> 38mb ram aproximately)
## Why Project FlareDB
Project flareDB as stated above is to aid our organisation [CodeTheEarth](https://github.com/CodeTheEarth) with a personal self hosted database to run our operations. That said, this is a completely open source project meaninig other developers can contribute, sponsor, take inspo from and self use for themselves >_<. This project should effectively solve the issues facing our organisation and other developers which relates to complexity of other databases and for some.. pricing.
